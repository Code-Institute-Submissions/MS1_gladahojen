### ___ BUGGS ___

Footer - responsive design won't work. Tried targeting classes. Asked on Slack

Carousel - Used Bootstrap to add a caarousel in the header. Wouldn't start.
    Googled "how to create a bootstrap carousel". Both sites 
    https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-carousel.php
    and
    https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp
    said that the code used to activate the carousel is *data-ride="carousel"*
    Change the code. Carousel works.

    Even though all photos in the carousel have the same height, an extra space is created 
    underneath the image befor Tires_bw.jpg and tools_bw.jpg. This makes the scetion below move 
    up and down when it changes image. Manage to change the background-color, but haven't figured
    out how to get rid of the extra space. Maybe a "marign-bottom"...?

Image sizeing - Googled "change image size css"
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15685666/changing-image-sizes-proportionally-using-css
